## 🚀 HOW TO USE

### GitHub Method (Recommended - Works Offline After First Load!)

**✅ BEST OF BOTH WORLDS:**

**Setup Process:**
1. **Greg:** Follow GitHub_Setup_Guide.pdf (15 minutes one-time setup)
2. **Upload 5 files to GitHub:** index.html, recipes-new.html, recipes-data.js, service-worker.js, README.md
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** to get your URL
4. **Share URL with Reyna** (text or email)
5. **Both:** Open URL on iPhone with WiFi → Cookbook loads and caches
6. **After that:** Works 100% offline - no internet needed!

**How It Works:**
- First visit: Needs internet to load and cache files
- All future visits: Works completely offline (even in airplane mode!)
- Updates: When you upload new recipes, next time there's internet it auto-updates
- Perfect for Honduras: Load once at home with WiFi, use anywhere offline
